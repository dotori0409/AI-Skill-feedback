# AI-feedback-system

The aim of this project is to develop an Artificial Intelligence-based solution that detects usersâ€™ skills in the virtual world, analyzes their performance, and provides personalized feedback to improve their individual reasoning and overall performance. By coaching them according to their situation, shortcomings and potential, the solution will help improve their skills and optimize their learning experience in Virtual Reality (VR) training software. 

**Assumptions:**
1. Data is accurate.
2. Data consists of only the completed results of each scenario.
3. Individual skills can be evaluated from a number ranging from 0 to 100 with 2 decimal precision.
4. There is an AI feedback system already created that provides personalized feedback when the skill history data is given as input.
